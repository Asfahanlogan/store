# ADMIN LOGIN FIX SOLUTION

## Problem
The admin login is not accepting the username and password from admin.json.

## Root Cause
The password hash in admin.json is not valid or was generated incorrectly.

## Solution
1. Generate a proper password hash for "SecureAdmin123!"
2. Update the admin.json file with the correct hash

## Implementation

The solution.php file in this directory will:
1. Generate a new password hash for "SecureAdmin123!"
2. Update the admin.json file with the correct hash
3. Allow you to login with:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: SecureAdmin123!

## Instructions

1. Run the solution.php file:
   ```
   php solution.php
   ```

2. Try logging in again at /admin/login.php with:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: SecureAdmin123!

## Verification

After running the solution, the admin.json file will contain a valid password hash that the login system can verify correctly.

## Additional Notes

- The password "SecureAdmin123!" is the default password
- You can change it after logging in through the admin panel
- Make sure the data/admin.json file has proper write permissions
